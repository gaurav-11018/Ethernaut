For the all peeps who missed out my super dope threads abt Ethernaut challenges, don't worry guys I still care for uğŸ˜‚ that's y I  have got a one line lesson summaries just for you guys.#Web3 #security 

FIVE LESSONS I LEARNT TO NOT GET HACKED:

LEVEL-0: Playing scavenger hunt! To get comfortable interacting with the website with the console.

LEVEL-1:  Don't Change contract ownership inside the fallback function.

LEVEL-2: Simple typo errors cause real pain in the ass.

LEVEL-3: True randomness is hard to achieve in native Solidity. Therefore its more advisable to use the help of oracles like chainlink.

LEVEL-4:Never use tx.origin to verify ownership, because this could lead to some nasty attacks. Use msg.sender instead.
msg.sender >>>>>> tx.origin.



Thats all! 



Stay safe and follow me...ğŸ˜‚
